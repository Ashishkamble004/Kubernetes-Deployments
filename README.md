# Kubernetes-Deployments

This Repo contains various Kubernetes Deployments ranging from LAMP Stack to HAProxy to basic nginx deployments as well, these contains the spec yamls for the deployments tried and tested versions. 

Explanation of basic Kubernetes Objects along with their YAMLS are also present, I keep on updating the repo twice a week, so expect new stuff almost often.

Happy Learning!
